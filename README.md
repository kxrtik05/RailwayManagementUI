## üíæ Database Setup

1. Create a database in MySQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE railway;
USE railway;

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
  password VARCHAR(50),
  role ENUM('admin', 'passenger') NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE trains (
  train_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  source VARCHAR(100),
  destination VARCHAR(100),
  departure_time TIME,
  arrival_time TIME,
  fare DOUBLE
);

CREATE TABLE passengers (
  passenger_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INT,
  gender VARCHAR(10),
  user_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
  booking_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  train_id INT,
  passenger_id INT,
  travel_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (train_id) REFERENCES trains(train_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (passenger_id) REFERENCES passengers(passenger_id)
);

CREATE TABLE payments (
  payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  booking_id INT,
  amount DOUBLE,
  method VARCHAR(20),
  payment_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (booking_id) REFERENCES bookings(booking_id)
);
```
Add default users manually or via code:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, password, role) VALUES 
('admin', 'admin123', 'admin'),
('passenger', 'pass123', 'passenger');
```
